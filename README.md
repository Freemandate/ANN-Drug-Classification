# ANN-Drug-Classification

## Description
This project implements an Artificial Neural Network (ANN-drug-classification) for drug classification based on input features.

## Getting Started
To get started with this project, follow these instructions to set up the environment and run the code.

### Prerequisites
Ensure the following are installed on your system:
- Python 3.8 or above
- Libraries:
  - NumPy
  - Pandas
  - Matplotlib
  - Scikit-learn

Install the libraries with:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn

### Installing
Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ANN-Drug-Classification.git
Navigate to the project directory
cd ANN-Drug-Classification
Open the ANN.ipynb file in Jupyter Notebook
jupyter notebook ANN.ipynb

### Running the Tests
To test the project:
1. Load the `drugdataset.csv` file into the notebook.
2. Execute the notebook cells to:
   - Load and preprocess the dataset.
   - Split the data into training and testing sets.
   - Train and evaluate the ANN model.
3. View the results, including accuracy and a confusion matrix.

## Deployment
This project is designed to run locally in Jupyter Notebook. No live deployment is necessary.
